When coverage drops below the threshold configured in the `jest.config.js` file, consider these options. These options are in order of priority.
1) Adding more behavioural tests (if it makes sense to do so).
2) If above isn't a good fit then we should consider adding a more scoped test for any peculiarities that are worth capturing (let's be very conscious of what's worth testing here, let's not chase coverage just for the sake of it). This is a good option if we have a specific/worthwhile gotcha that is worth capturing at more implementation-level (like a colocated, specific-use,utility function).
3) If neither 1) nor 2) fit, then consider if there are lines of code that we could exclude from coverage using comment/compiler directives for Jest? This should ONLY be done for concerns that simply do not make sense testing. This would help us "increase" coverage by being conscious and honest about parts of code that just don't make sense testing or are incorrectly flagged as uncovered. Only do this honestly if needed, but it's an option.
4) Finally if neither of those are good fit (use your judgement and context about the codebase/unit of behaviour we're covering here), then let's reduce our jest coverage metric bar to lower percentage. This is last resort, and should be explicitly checked with the supervisor before actioning.
